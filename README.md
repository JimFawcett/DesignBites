Here are the current Design Bites:

   - Design Track Summary
   - Design: What?, Why?, So What?, Why Not?
   - Introduction
     TextFinder design: Concept development, Architecture, TextFinder Specification, Implementation
   - Design
     Initial thoughts about design: concept, design, design evolution, design document, building a design, presenting designs
     Structure
     Why does TextFinder require a flow architecture?
   - Basic
     Monolithic structure with code implementing file line counting.
   - Factored
     Factored: Executive, Input, Compute, Output - code with user-defined types and tests.
   - DataFlow
     DataFlow: components arranged in data pipeline - code with user-defined types and tests.
   - TypeErase
     TypeErase: components with interfaces and object factories - code with user-defined types and tests.
   - PlugIn
     PlugIn: Output component is plugged into Compute at run-time - code with user-defined types and tests.
