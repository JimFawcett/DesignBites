# DesignBites
Demonstration code for Basics, e.g., Platform, Programming, and Object Models

Just starting. No code demos yet.
Here are the current Design Bites:

   - <a href=https://jimfawcett.github.io/indexDesign.html>Design Track Summary</a><br />
     What?, Why?, So What?, Why Not?
   - <a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/Resources/DesignBites/DesignBites_Intro.html">Introduction</a><br />
     Concept development, Architecture, TextFinder Specification, Implementation
   - <a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/Resources/DesignBites/Design.html">Design and Documentation</a><br />
     Initial thoughts about design: concept, design, design evolution, design document, building a design, presenting designs
   - Structure<br />
     Why does TextFinder require a flow architecture?
   - Basic<br />
     Monolithic structure with code implementing file line counting.
   - Factored<br />
     Factored: Executive, Input, Compute, Output.
   - DataFlow<br />
     Components arranged in data pipeline provides continuous output.
   - TypeErase<br />
     Components with interfaces and object factories decouple components.
   - PlugIn<br />
     Output component is plugged into Compute at run-time.
